# Agentic-AI-for-Local-Food-Security-Wastage-Reduction-System

## Problem Statement

Food wastage remains a major challenge across communities — large quantities of edible food are discarded daily by restaurants, grocery stores, and individuals due to poor coordination between donors and charities. At the same time, many local shelters and food banks struggle to meet the nutritional needs of vulnerable groups.
Traditional food donation systems rely on manual coordination, phone calls, or volunteer-led logistics, which causes delays, mismatch of supply-demand, and ultimately wastage of perishable food.

There is a need for an intelligent, automated platform that can collect real-time food donation data, assess its freshness, match it dynamically with nearby charities, and facilitate smooth redistribution with minimal human effort.

## Proposed Solution

The system leverages **Agentic AI** to automate food donation and redistribution through three key agents:

- **Donation Intake Agent** → Collects and validates food donation data from donors (via web form or chat), checks expiry, and assigns a freshness urgency score.  
- **Matching & Allocation Agent** → Matches available food with compatible charities based on food type, storage capacity, proximity, and urgency.  

Together, these agents ensure **efficient food allocation and minimal waste** across all participants.
